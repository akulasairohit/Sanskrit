## Note on Vedic Texts

The Vedic text corpus included in this software (Upaniṣads, Bhagavad Gītā, 
Bhāgavata Purāṇa excerpts) consists of public domain texts that predate 
copyright. Translations and commentaries are based on traditional scholarly 
works also in the public domain.

This software is developed with respect for the sacred nature of these texts 
and aims to promote their accessibility and preservation for educational and 
scholarly purposes.
