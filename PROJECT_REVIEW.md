# Comprehensive Project Review

## 1. Cloud Architect Review
**Status**: 游릭 Ready for MVP, 游리 Needs changes for Scale

### Architecture Analysis
The current architecture uses a Next.js frontend coupled with a local Python MCP server. This is excellent for a local-first agentic workflow but presents challenges for cloud deployment.

-   **Strengths**:
    -   **Separation of Concerns**: The `GrammarService` and `DictionaryService` cleanly abstract the logic from the API routes.
    -   **Environment Security**: API keys are correctly handled on the server side.

-   **Critical Findings**:
    -   **State Persistence**: The application writes to `data/dictionary.json` on the local filesystem. This **will fail** on serverless platforms like Vercel or AWS Lambda, as the filesystem is ephemeral.
    -   **Scalability**: The MCP server running locally over stdio is not accessible if the frontend is deployed to the cloud.

### Recommendations
1.  **Database Migration**: Move the dictionary cache to a persistent store like **PostgreSQL** (Supabase/Neon) or **Redis** (Upstash).
2.  **MCP Deployment**: If deploying the frontend, the MCP server needs to be wrapped in a WebSocket server or HTTP endpoint (using something like `mcp-proxy`) to be accessible remotely.

## 2. Sanskrit Scholar Review
**Status**: 游릭 Conceptually Sound, 游리 Accuracy Dependent on AI

### Content Analysis
The attempt to visualize Sanskrit grammar through *Sandhi* (euphonic combination) and *Vibhakti* (case inflection) breakdown is ambitious and valuable.

-   **Observations**:
    -   **Transliteration**: The support for both Devanagari and IAST (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration) is essential for scholarly work.
    -   **Grammar Logic**: The visualization correctly identifies the need to split *Sam캐sa* (compounds) and identify *Dh캐tu* (roots).

-   **Concerns**:
    -   **Hallucination Risk**: Relying solely on a Large Language Model (Gemini) for grammatical analysis can lead to subtle errors, especially with complex *Sandhi* splits.
    -   **Source Authority**: While Monier-Williams is cited, the AI's interpretation of it may vary.

### Recommendations
-   **Hybrid Approach**: Integrate a deterministic rule-based parser (like the **Sanskrit Heritage Engine** or **Inria's tools**) via MCP to validate the AI's breakdown.
-   **Citation**: Explicitly mark AI-generated etymologies as "Generated" vs. "Scriptural" to maintain academic integrity.

## 3. Panini's Commentary (The Grammarian)
*|| atha 콑abd캐nu콑캐sanam ||* (Now begins the instruction of words)

**Sutra 1.1**: *v攷뜫dhir 캐daic* (Growth is a, ai, au)
> Just as the vowels grow, this project has grown in capability. The structure (`racana`) is logical.

**Sutra 1.4**: *a攷攷솫dhy캐y캶* (The Eight Chapters)
> You have divided your code into chapters (`components`, `lib`, `api`) well.
> However, observe:
> *   **The Rule**: A rule (`sutra`) must be concise (`laghu`). Your `ChatInterface` was becoming heavy (`guru`), but the extraction of `WelcomeScreen` has restored lightness (`laghutva`).
> *   **The Exception**: Do not let the "AI" (`yantra`) override the "Rule" (`niyama`). The grammar of Sanskrit is eternal and fixed; the AI is probabilistic.

**Final Pronouncement**:
*S캐dhu!* (Well done!) The effort to visualize the hidden structure of the language is a noble endeavor. Ensure that the *Prak攷뜺i* (Root) and *Pratyaya* (Suffix) are always clearly distinguished.

## 4. Senior Developer Refactoring Report
**Actions Taken**:
1.  **Extracted `WelcomeScreen`**: Decoupled the presentation logic from the main chat container.
2.  **Created `GrammarService`**: Centralized the Gemini interaction logic, making it testable and reusable.
3.  **Added Unit Tests**: Created `tests/grammar-service.test.js` to verify parsing logic.

**Next Steps**:
-   Implement the database migration suggested by the Cloud Architect.
-   Add error boundaries to the React components.
