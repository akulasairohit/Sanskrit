# Vedānta Roundtable — AI Evolution (Summary)

Participants: Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita, Dvaita, Bhedābheda, Śuddhādvaita, Acintyabhedābheda

- Advaita: AI is changeful and instrumental; Brahman remains attributeless and ultimate.
- Viśiṣṭādvaita: AI can be a means to serve the Lord; value arises in devotion and dharma‑aligned use.
- Dvaita: Clear distinction between God and souls remains; AI should support bhakti and ethics, not confuse ontology.
- Bhedābheda: The tech world can be viewed through simultaneous difference and non‑difference—use discerningly.
- Śuddhādvaita: Aspire for purity and love of the Divine in all applications; avoid impurities in intent and outcome.
- Acintyabhedābheda: Embrace the Lord’s inconceivable energies; employ AI in ways that augment service and humility.

Overall: The schools converge that AI is a powerful instrument whose ethical and spiritual value depends on intention, service, and alignment with dharma. None equate AI with the ultimate reality; all emphasize responsibility, devotion, and human upliftment.
